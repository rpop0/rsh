### Simple linux command line interpreter

This is a simple linux command line interpreter I created for my Operating Systems class. It is able to interpret all of the commands on linux, and it is also able to handle piping, redirecting and so on.

The interpreter also has a server implemented in it, which you can remotely connect to from the client file included.

This repo also includes three commands that were re-created.
